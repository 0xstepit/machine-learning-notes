# MACHINE LEARNING NOTES

```diff
! please open all the notebooks with Colab since seems that GitHub has problem in visualizing long equations and didn't print them

This repo is intended to assemble a collection of Colab Notebooks of the course Machine Learning (097683) given by Professor [Marcello Restelli](http://home.deib.polimi.it/restelli/MyWebSite/teaching.shtml) at Politecnico di Milano. The material is a reworking of the slides provided by the professor, his lessons, slides of professor [Daniele Loiacono](http://home.deib.polimi.it/loiacono/) and some supplementary material from the book ["Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning"](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf) by Bishop, ["An Introduction to Statistical Learning"](https://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ISLR%20Seventh%20Printing.pdf) by James, Witten, Hastie & Tibshirani, ["Machine Learning"](http://profsite.um.ac.ir/~monsefi/machine-learning/pdf/Machine-Learning-Tom-Mitchell.pdf) by Mitchel and ["Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction"](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf) by Sutton & Barto.
